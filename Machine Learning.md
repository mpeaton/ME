      * The least-squares problem (1.4) and linear programming problem (1.5) are both special cases of the general convex optimization problem (1.8).
      * Interior-point methods work very well in practice, and in some cases can be proved to solve the problem to a specified accuracy with a number of operations that does not exceed a polynomial of the problem dimensions.
